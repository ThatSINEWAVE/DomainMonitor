# Webhook-Watcher

Webhook-Watcher is a Python script designed to monitor the status of specified domains and report changes to a Discord channel using webhooks. It periodically checks the status of each domain, logs the results, and sends notifications for any status changes.

## Features

- **Domain Monitoring**: Webhook-Watcher monitors the status of specified domains by sending HTTP HEAD requests and checking for successful responses.
- **Discord Notifications**: It sends notifications to a Discord channel via webhooks for any status changes of the monitored domains.
- **Logging**: Webhook-Watcher maintains a log of the monitoring results for each domain, keeping track of response times and status changes.
- **Customization**: Easily add or remove domains to monitor by modifying the `domains.json` file.
